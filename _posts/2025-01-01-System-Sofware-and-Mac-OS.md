### Versions of the Classic Mac OS

Wikipedia has list of the different versions of Mac OS versions.

- [Classic Macintosh OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS)

### What versions of the Mac OS are available online?

Various versions of the Mac OS from System 6 are available for free online. I recommend the Apple legacy recovery CD, since it contains many versions and compatibility for many different Classic Mac's.

- [Apple Legacy recovery CD](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/apple-legacy-software-recovery-cd)

System 6.0.8 will work just fine for most System 6.x installations. If you really need an earlier version of 6.x (possibly due to size constraints), well, they're there for you to get. 
System 7 Tune-up (HIGHLY recommended).

### Which version of the Mac OS is best for my Mac?

In general, if a Mac can run up to 7.6.1, 7.1 is the ideal version for it. If it can run up to 7.6.1 and you need the features in 7.5.x and up, use 7.6.1. Most stock Macintoshes, in my experience are at their fastest with the version of the OS one generation previous to the maximum supported on that machine. (I'm not counting 7.5.x and 7.6.x as different generations, since 7.6.x was essentially a bug-fix and PPC code update to 7.5.x.) Note that these recommendations DO NOT apply to Macs upgraded with a faster/newer processor.

If you have a Plus, SE (any model), or Classic, use System 6.0.8 unless you absolutely need the features of System 7.

If you have any 020- or 030-based Mac, 7.1 is generally the best for it but 7.5.x/7.6.x will run acceptably well. Major exceptions are the IIfx, which runs well all the way to 8.1, and the LCs (including the Classic II and Colour Classic) prior to the LC III, which should NOT use anything past 7.1 if you want to keep your sanity.

Quadras are fastest with Mac OS 7.1, but if you need HFS Plus support or have a PPC card, use Mac OS 8.1.

### System Enablers

System Enablers are pieces of software that add support for certain machines to the Mac OS. For example, the IIvx came out after System 7.1 was finalised, and thus support for the IIvx is not built into System 7.1. The Enabler 001 file adds this necessary support, and a Mac IIvx will not boot under System 7.1 without it. If your Mac shipped with an enabler (check out AppleSpec to see if it did), make sure you don't remove that file from the System Folder. If you have extraneous Enablers, however, you can safely remove them. 

### Disk images

Those "disk images" require you to use Disk Copy 4.2 or Disk Copy 6.3.3 (both available from Apple) to mount them. If you want to make floppies from them, use the "Make Floppy" command in Disk Copy after mounting an image from within Disk Copy. And please, read the Disk Copy README file. It's really not that hard to do.

### What extras to add to System 7.1 to make it more like 7.5?

First, install System 7.1 Update 3. Once you've done, you want to get the CFM-68K Runtime Enabler 4.0, ObjectSupportLib 1.2 (included with CFM-68K download), Drag Manager 1.1, and Thread Manager. Make sure you install Finder 7.1.3 as well. It's in the Thread Manager package, inside the Finder 7.1.3 folder.

When you get those installed, restart and then install Open Transport 1.1 and 1.1.2.

- [Drag Manager 1.1](http://ftpmirror.your.org/pub/misc/apple/ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/Macintosh_Drag_-_Drop.sit.hqx)
- [Thread Manager](http://ftpmirror.your.org/pub/misc/apple/ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/Thread_Manager.sit.hqx)
- [Open Transport 1.1](http://ftpmirror.your.org/pub/misc/apple/ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/OpenTransport/OT1.1/OpenTransportInstaller.sea.hqx)
- [Open Transport 1.1.2](http://ftpmirror.your.org/pub/misc/apple/ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/OpenTransport/OT1.1.2/OpenTransportInstall.sea.hqx)

If you want the Mac OS 8 look, you can install the Appearance Manager, and for a hierarchical Apple menu, just copy over the Apple Menu Options control panel from a 7.5.x/7.6.x installation. WindowShade can be installed in a similar fashion.
