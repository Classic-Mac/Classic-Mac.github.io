### Where can I get a word processor for my Mac?

WordPerfect 3.5e, which runs on nearly every Macintosh ever made (with the exception of the 68000-based Macs), is available for free. Some tidbits for it are available here as well.

Microsoft Word 6 is a terrible word processor; if you must use Word, try and get 5.1a. It's not free, but you can sometimes find a copy on eBay or by asking around. Word 4 is also a pretty good program.

The various Works programs are pretty good, particularly later versions of Claris (now Apple) Works. They will also run on almost any Macintosh and have a reasonably complete feature set. Again, eBay is probably your best source since these aren't free either.

Some people swear by Mariner Write or WriteNow (which is no longer available for purchase). I've never used them but they're supposed to be pretty good.

Of course, any mention of Mac word processors would be incomplete without mentioning the excellent and free Nisus Writer 4.1.6, which is still available for download.

If you're running System 6, a lot of the above programs won't work. To find one that will, check out Marten van de Kraats's System 6 Heaven.


### Where can I get other productivity software for my Mac?

If you're running System 6, Marten van de Kraats has an extremely useful site called System 6 Heaven. Bill Jagitsch runs a similarly useful site called JAG's House that is mostly dedicated to System 6 software. Some very old software (mostly System 6-compatible stuff) can be found at the Vieuxmac site.

- [MacintoshRepository](https://www.macintoshrepository.org)
- [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20160827204614/)

If you're running System 7 or up, your best bet is to check out the software on the two sites mentioned above and see if what you want will run on System 7. Where to get it? eBay is probably your best bet for obtaining a legal copy, but most software from before 1996 is getting extremely difficult to track down. Begging and groveling are useful as well.


## Miscellaneous Software
### Where can I get 68K software?

David Wood's Resources for the Older Macintosh is also a good site. The VieuxMac site is one of the best for very old software, and Marten van de Kraats's System 6 Heaven and Bill Jagitsch's JAG's House sites are also very useful for System 6-era software and information.

The usual archive sites still apply, of course - Info-Mac and UMich are still great places to get old software, and they're well-organised and on fast connections.


### Can I run UNIX/Linux on my Mac?

Penelope has also covered this on his site. I'm not going to totally pass the buck, though. NetBSD will run on most Macs from the Mac II on up. JAG has a tutorial on running Debian Linux on an SE/30 (which should be somewhat applicable to other Vintage Macs). Warning: unless you're a real geek and have a desire to play around a LOT with stuff that doesn't always make sense, don't bother with trying to run Linux or UNIX on your Mac.

Lots more information is available at Pure-Mac, including information on A/UX, Apple's UNIX variant from the early 1990s.

### Can I play MP3 files on my 68K Mac?

Well, sort of. Two recent developments have enabled the playing of MP3s downsampled to mono and 22.4KHz on a 68040-based Mac. (No, an FPU isn't required, although it certainly doesn't hurt.) Neither supports anything remotely similar to the feature set of, say, iTunes, but both will work as a "proof of concept" or technology demonstration. What are these two wonders, you ask? They are mpg-123, version 1.1 (a 207K download) and MpegDec 2.5.3 (an 866 KB download that claims to work as far back as a 68020).

While I don't use either one, the consensus seems to be that MpegDec is greatly superior to mpg-123 as far as features go, although both are supposedly equally adept at playing MP3s.
