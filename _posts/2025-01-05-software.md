### Where can I get software and games for my Mac?

You can find most software available at:

- [MacintoshGarden](https://macintoshgarden.org)
- [MacintoshRepository](https://www.macintoshrepository.org)
- [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20160827204614/)


### Can I run UNIX/Linux on my Mac?

Penelope has also covered this on his site. NetBSD will run on most Macs from the Mac II on up.  Warning: unless you're a real geek and have a desire to play around a LOT with stuff that doesn't always make sense, don't bother with trying to run Linux or UNIX on your Mac.
